# VR_Assignment_RNN-Recurrent_Neural_Network-
## Visual Recognition Assignment On RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and their Application.

1. Derive expressions for 𝜕𝑏 and 𝜕𝑏 for the RNN discussed in class. Include the derived bias update ℎ 𝑦
equations in the RNN code shared(RNN_from_Scratch.ipynb) and train the RNN for a sentence/word.
Record relevant observations during training. 

# 2 . i) Train an RNN using pytorch to predict the string “Acknowledgement” giving the starting character as ‘A’.

# ii) Modify the RNN so as to predict the string “edgement” giving the starting character as ‘e’ .

# All included in the Report:-

 ## ii) Code for RNN training using pytorch for 2(i) and 2 (ii)
 ## iii) A technical report detailing:
## a) Derivations for Q.1 and analysis of training performance for Q.1
## b) Training level performance analysis of Q.2(i)
## c) Training level performance analysis of Q.2(ii) and architectural modifications done (if any)
